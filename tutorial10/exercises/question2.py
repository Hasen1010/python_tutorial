# TODO: This program is to compute the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, which is the side opposite
#       to the right angle, after the user provides the lengths of the other two sides
#
# Sample 1:
# Input the length of one side: 3
# Input the length of the other side: 4
# The length of the hypotenuse is 5.
