#
# Given a positive integer, we would like to reduce it to zero as follows. In each step, if the value is odd, reduce
# it by 1. Otherwise, divide it by 2. Complete the following program to find out the number of steps required to reduce
# the value to 0.

print("Input a positive integer: ", end="")
n = int(input())

# TODO: replace here with the code to compute the number of steps to reduce n to 0. Output the result to the variable
#       num_steps.

print("The required number of steps is {}.".format(num_steps))
